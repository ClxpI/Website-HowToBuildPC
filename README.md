# Website-HowToBuildPC
A fully responsive website demonstrating a step-by-step guide to building a personal computer from scratch. This website provides step-by-step instructions, images, and a clean, easy-to-navigate layout to help users choose components, assemble their PC, and get everything set up. Built with HTML and CSS, it reflects my skills in web development and UX/UI design, while also showing my ability to create clear, user-friendly tutorials.

## What I Learned

### Web Development Skills:
- **HTML/CSS**: Gained experience building responsive, user-friendly websites with HTML and CSS.
- **UI/UX Design**: Focused on clean, easy-to-follow navigation, creating a smooth user experience throughout the website.
- **Responsive Design**: Learned how to design a website that is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial Creation:
- **Component Selection**: Designed a clear flow for selecting the right PC components for various needs (gaming, content creation, etc.).
- **Assembly Instructions**: Created detailed steps and accompanying images to help users assemble their PCs with ease.
- **Helpful Resources**: Incorporated links to tools like PCPartPicker to help users make informed decisions when selecting parts. This tool shows what components are compatible and what is the current lowest price you can buy the product for.

### Project Organization:
- **Modular Design**: Organized the content into easily navigable steps, ensuring the tutorial is straightforward and approachable.
- **Image Integration**: Used images of PC components to enhance the tutorialâ€™s clarity and make the learning process more visual and engaging.

## How to Access the Website Code

To explore the code of the website, you can browse the repository. Key files include:

- **index.html**: The homepage of the website that introduces the tutorial and directs users to the first step.
- **step1.html**: The first step of the tutorial, guiding users through selecting the right components for their build.
- **style.css**: Contains the website's styling, ensuring a clean and modern design.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to enhance the website with new features:

- **More Detailed Steps**: Expand the tutorial with short videos demonstrating the process.
